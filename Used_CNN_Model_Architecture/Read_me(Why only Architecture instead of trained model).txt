I giving hear the architecture which can used to train the model becouse i can't push the 
trained CNN model becouse of it size(500mb+) the git can only include a file
which is upto 100mb so i can't able to push the trained model 

so iam giving the model architecture(tensorflow code) which can be able to use in traing the model and creating

if you need the brain_tumour dataset and trained model which is trained and created by me just follow thw below steps :

step 1 : join this private telegram channel using given link

step 2 : after join on the channel you can use the given links to download the trained model and used datasets and also the entair project
